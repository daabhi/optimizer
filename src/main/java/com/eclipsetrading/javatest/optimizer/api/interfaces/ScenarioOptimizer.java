/**
 * <p>
 * The optimizer takes in a collection of scenarios (original) and attempts to determine a more optimal collection of scenarios (optimal).
 * </p>
 * The optimal must:
 * <ul>
 * <li>have the same or lower cost than the original for each underlying asset</li>
 * <li>have the same set of bumps as the original for each underlying asset</li>
 * <li>have the same or higher frequency than the original, for each bump and underlying asset</li>
 * </ul>

 * The following table shows the optimal solutions from given inputs as examples.
